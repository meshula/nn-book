Robotic Control - General
-------------------------

This is an area of research which is slowly emerging as an important field of study in neural networks. Most of the problems associated with robotic task planning and execution have been individually attacked using neural networks, but a central unifying vision is still lacking
(cf. Brooks, Minsky, Ozguner for attempts at decentralized distributed control).

Robotics - Vehicles
-------------------

See also Robotic Control and Proprioceptive Sensing

The motivated behaviours of the systems inspired by Braitenberg's classic Vehicles are among the most sophisticated and robust ever achieved by artificial intelligence systems (cf. Brooks, 1986). For the most part still overlooked by the mainstream, this notion for intelligent control will probably be the most fruitful of all AI methodologies in the future.

Signal Processing - Multi-Signal Separation
-------------------------------------------

See also Sonar and Radar Signal Processing, and Sound Source Localization and Biological Signal Processing

The separation and processing of multiple signals is uncharted territory. Spatio-temporal signal processing with neural networks remains largely an unsolved problem, and therefore little progress
in the related subordinate fields has been made.

Signal Processing - Sonar and Radar
-----------------------------------

Most of these applications involve analysis of the spectral content of returned sonar or radar signals to characterize or identify targets. Almost all use back propagation or a variant thereof to learn certain exemplar patterns; almost all report good results but long training times. Note that few of these applications involve spatio-temporal signal processing. In most cases, sonar or radar returns are represented as static patterns which are presented to static neural  networks.

Signal Processing - Sound Source Localization
---------------------------------------------

Much progress has been made in understanding the biological mechanisms for sound source localization. Rigorous studies by Konishi and Suga of the owl and the bat have formed the basis of almost all the data available. With the exception of Mead's silicon cochlea and auditory localization mechanisms, this detailed neurophysiological knowledge stands waiting for application, and is thus an important untapped resource.

Signal Processing - SpatioTemporal
----------------------------------

Despite the large number of references listed for this section, spatio-temporal signal processing by neural networks remains one of the most important unsolved problems. The major players in this arena are the proponents of recurrent back propagation methods (cf. Pearlmutter, 1989), Fukushima's latest versions of the NeoCognitron, Kohonen's Self Organizing Feature Nets, and Waibel's Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN).

Of these methods, the NeoCognitroarpenter and Grossberg's Adaptive Resonance Theory has yet to prove itself for this application.


Of these methods, the NeoCognitron and TDNN show the most promise for robust performance. Sharing many similarities, the principle feature of these networks is progressive hierarchical feature extraction.

Vision - General
----------------

Of all the components of the nervous system, the visual system is perhaps most well studied. Starting with the seminal work of Hubel and Wiesel on orientation sensitive cells in the visual cortex, understanding of the visual system has progressed rapidly. Though not yet widespread,
the most successful computer vision systems to date are those which make use of the data collected by neurophysiologists.

Vision - Image Compression
--------------------------

Work is progressing quietly on the image compression front. Compression ratios on the order of 60-75% are regularly achieved, although quality varies. As in spatio-temporal signal processing, the biggest progress seems to come from those networks which implement progressive hierarchical
feature extraction.
